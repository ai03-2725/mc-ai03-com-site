			## Semi-Private Community

      mc.ai03.com is a semi-private community.  
      Only invited members may join.  

      ## Invites

      Each member has two invites, which they can use to invite others to the community.  
      These invites are irreversible and permanent.  
        
      If a member violates the community rules, the invitee may also be held responsible.  

      ## Being Invited

      The simplest method is to ask someone with access to use one of their two invites via the /invite command.  
      Another method is to ask ai03 in their [Discord](https://ai03.com/social/) in the correct channels - given enough server capacity and proof of credibility, an invite may be issued directly.
