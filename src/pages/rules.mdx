			## The Basics

			- Keep chat civil and welcoming. No illegal activities, spam, NSFW content, etc.
      - Keep things all-age, all-race, all-gender friendly.
      - Please refrain from discussing sensitive topics such as politics and religion.
      - No griefing, cheating, hacking, or other harmful/unfair gameplay.
      - Refrain from constructions that excessively strain the server such as lag machines.
      In summary, behave like mature adults with basic etiquette.

      ## Unique Rules
      - In general, please keep gameplay cooperative rather than hostile.
      - PvP is allowed only with prior agreement from those involved.
      - Mind others' efforts, property, and space; ask for permission when necessary.
      - If there is conflict, discuss and resolve in an orderly manner.

      ## Invite System

      Read about the invite system [here](/invites).
      - Each member may invite up to two others into the community using the /invite command.
      - In case of community rule violations, the person who invited the violator is held simultaneously responsible.

      ## On Exploits

      Due to their game-breaking nature, "valid exploits" such as TNT/rail/carpet duplication, bedrock breaking, nether roof farming, and similar overpowered abuses are prohibited.

      ## Other

      See /help in-game for a list of other usable commands and utilities.  
      For emergency contact or reporting rule violations, please contact ai03 via in-game chat or Discord.
