      ## Gameplay

      - The server is vanilla Minecraft aside from the changes below.  
      - Overpowered exploits available in the vanilla game are disabled.
        - Use of the nether roof is disabled and prohibited due to its overpowered nature.  
        - Vanilla "silently approved" exploits such as TNT/carpet/rail duping are disabled and prohibited due to the same reasons.  
      - The player sleep percentage is currently 30% (30% of the players online must sleep to pass the night.)

      ## Custom Crafting Recipes

      - Renewable Sand  
        8 stone + 1 iron ingot = 3 sand

      <Image src={SandRecipe} alt="Sand recipe screenshot" class="md:max-w-2/3 lg:max-w-1/2 xl:max-w-1/3" />
      
      - Renewable Gravel  
        8 cobblestone + 1 iron ingot = 3 gravel

      <Image src={GravelRecipe} alt="Gravel recipe screenshot" class="md:max-w-2/3 lg:max-w-1/2 xl:max-w-1/3" />

      <></>

			## Map Limits and Changes

      - The current world border radii are the following:
        - 3000 for the overworld (6000x6000 total)
        - 750 for the nether (1500x1500 total)
        - 4000 for the end (8000x8000 total)
      - The world borders will be increased incrementally after each version update to allow access to new content.  
      - The nether scaling is set to 1:4 rather than 1:8.
        - This is subject to change at a future date if the world size increases massively.
