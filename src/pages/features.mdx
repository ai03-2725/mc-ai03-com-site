      ## Gameplay

      - The server is vanilla Minecraft aside from the changes below.  
      - Overpowered exploits available in the vanilla game are disabled.
        - Use of the nether roof is disabled and prohibited due to its overpowered nature.  
        - Vanilla "silently approved" exploits such as TNT/carpet/rail duping are disabled and prohibited due to the same reasons.  
      - The player sleep percentage is currently 30%. (30% of the players must sleep to pass the night.)

			## Map Limits and Changes

      - The current world border radii are the following:
        - 2000 for the overworld (4000x4000 total)
        - 500 for the nether (1000x1000 total)
        - 4000 for the end (8000x8000 total)
      - The world borders will be increased incrementally after each version update to allow access to new content.  
      - The nether scaling is set to 1:4 rather than 1:8.
        - This is subject to change at a future date if the world size increases massively.
