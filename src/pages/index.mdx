			## Overview

			**mc.ai03.com** is a small Minecraft community operated by ai03 of [ai03 Design Studio](https://ai03.com).  
			The server implements the following features:

			- The community is semi-private, with each new member requiring an invite from another community member or approval from ai03 directly.  
			  Each member has two invites which they may choose to use to invite others.
			
			- The gameplay is semi-vanilla, with over-powered exploits such as vanilla item duplication prohibited to keep gameplay challenging and engaging.  

			- The community is designed to be self-governing and collaborative rather than hostile or dictated by excessive rules and protections.  

			### Joining

			The fastest way to join the community is to be invited by an existing member.  
			ai03 may occasionally invite members directly on request.  

			Once invited, connecting to the ip `mc.ai03.com` via the game client should allow for gameplay.  
			If the connection does not succeed, `mc-direct.ai03.com:25641` should serve as a fallback.
